# Web3 Slots smart contract

I made this example project to practice writing solidity contracts and interacting with web3 wallets via ethers.js.
This project is a very basic slot machine game and a barebones UI to go with it.

I used a starter project from MetaCrafters to kick me off: https://github.com/MetacrafterChris/SCM-Starter.git

# Starter Next/Hardhat Project

After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/
